                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <p>Wool samples found in ancient Harappa artifacts resemble Pashmina and Shahtoosh. This material gained fame in Kashmir shawls and Mughal times, symbolizing rank and nobility. Babur founded the Mughal Empire in India, introducing elaborate clothing like khalat, often made of pashmina.</p>
                <p>Kashmir was conquered by Akbar in 1568, where pashmina shawls played a role in khil'at ceremonies. Iranian emperors also embraced pashmina. Wealthy women in India, Pakistan, and Nepal considered pashmina blankets essential in their dowries. In English literature, Kashmiri shawls were linked to women's luxuries and heirlooms. In France, Empress Joséphine popularized the pashmina Kashmir shawl, becoming a symbol of French bourgeois status from the Bourbon Restoration to the Second French Empire.</p>

                <h1>PRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Pashmina comes from goats that shed their winter coat each spring, yielding about 80-170 grams (3-6 oz) of fiber. This fine undercoat is collected through combing, not shearing, as in other wool types. The Changpa people in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas, living at high altitudes and frigid temperatures, rear pashmina goats for their wool, while sheep are raised for meat.

                    The raw pashmina is sent to Kashmir for traditional handcrafted processing, including combing, spinning, weaving, and finishing, primarily centered in Srinagar. Crafting a single pashmina stole (70x200cm) takes around 180 hours.
                    
                    Globally, China produces 70% of cashmere, Mongolia 20%, and the remaining 10% comes from various countries, with only a small portion being the ultra-fine pashmina cashmere.</p>
